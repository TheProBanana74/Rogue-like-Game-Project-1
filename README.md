Rogue-like Game Project
This repo is a portfolio for a python-based 2D Roguelike video game I am creating.

Please take a look at the "requirements.txt" file to see what packages are needed outside of the
newest version of Python 3. To install the packages, enter the following command into your
virtual environment/ console: "pip install -r requirements.txt".

The engine base for this game is based on the "[Roguelike Tutorials](https://rogueliketutorials.com/)" website.
